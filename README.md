# Tradie Job Front-end App

## Start up

* To start the application, open a terminal in the root directory and type 'cd client' to navigate to the client directory
* Type 'npm install' into the terminal to install dependencies
* Type 'npm start' into the terminal to start the local React server

The application should then open in your browser on localhost:3000.

## Non-functional Components

* Filtering feature
* Adding/editing notes for a job
* Changing the status of a job

## Supporting code in a full-stack application

Within a fully functional full-stack application, this application would require a database and API server in order to facilitate retrieval of data from the database via request from the client. This application in its current state uses hard-coded test data provided in /data/jobs.json.
